  <h3>WWDC 2012</h3>
  <div class="postDate">27 Jun 2012</div>
  <div class="postBody"><p>I have even surprised myself. I am much more excited about iOS 6.0 than OS X Mountain Lion. There are so many useful things coming to iOS that I don&#39;t know where or what to begin with. First, let me address the presentation. What was that boxing noise during Philip Schiller&#39;s presentation? I could not suppress it! It seems that another microphone was left on elsewhere and the person carrying it was moving, bumping or breathing into it. I cannot wait for the day we make commercial use of wireless microphones. By wireless microphones I don&#39;t mean the ones that consist of transmitters and transreceivers, but rather the ones used for reconnaissance purposes. Anyway, I am going on a tangent, the presentation was overall very smooth.</p>

<p>What a nice piece of art and engineering. Of course, I am talking about the newly announced Macbook Pro. The side-grills look aesthetically pleasing. Currently, retina display on a laptop does not sound particularly intriguing. As the resolution increases, so does the demand of battery and GPU. In such scenario, the heat becomes an issue of concern too.</p>

<p>I like the new Xcode as just another application a lot. Albeit being skeptical at the beginning, I&#39;ve come to believe that this might be the best solution to fit a large set of tools in a single and easily upgradable package.</p>

<p>The addition of new object and expression literals makes for much more readable code. The <span class="code">@synthesize</span> statements in class implementations are no longer required. Another compiler optimization, especially for library publishers, is the ability to define a privately consumed method after the first call to it occurs in the implementation file. Therefore, avoiding the risk of exposing the private interface to the public by mentioning it in the header file or even being required to define that method prior to usage in the implementation file.</p>

<p>Finally, constraint based layouts are coming to iOS. They are undoubtedly more useful in a mobile environment, because iOS is running on a varity of hardware sizes, screen dimensions and resolutions. Not to mention that every time these devices change orientation, all UI elements have to adjust themselves accordingly. The introduction of such feature might incentivize many application developers to support alternative localizations too.</p>
